# **Drug Addiction Forecasting using Machine Learning**  

This project utilizes **machine learning algorithms** to predict **drug addiction trends** based on demographic, psychological, and social factors. By analyzing historical data, the model identifies key **risk factors** contributing to substance abuse. **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression** are used for prediction, achieving high accuracy. **Explainable AI (LIME)** provides insights into feature importance, ensuring transparency in decision-making. The dataset includes **211 records** with 21 attributes from various sources. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. The trained model helps policymakers, healthcare professionals, and social workers in **early intervention strategies**. Performance evaluation is done using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC**. The project includes data visualization and interpretability tools for better insights. This repository contains **code, dataset, and analysis reports** for further research and development. ðŸš€
